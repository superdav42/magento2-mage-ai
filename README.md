# Magento 2 MageAI Extension
This Magento 2 extension integrates **OpenAI (GPT)**, **Anthropic (Claude)**, and **Google Gemini** to automatically generate high-quality short and long product descriptions, **AI-generated product images**, and **AI image editing of existing product photos** — based on product attributes like name, features, material, and more. It's a powerful tool to save time and improve content quality across your catalog.

❤️ The goal of this extension is to remain fully open-source and continuously expand by integrating every possible way to use AI with Magento 2. From writing content to helping customers, improving SEO, or automating tasks — the idea is to make Magento and AI work great together. I'm building it to be flexible and helpful for everyone, and I'd love for others to join in. If you're into Magento or AI, your ideas and contributions are always welcome. Let's create something awesome together!

## Features
- **Multi-provider AI support** — switch between OpenAI (GPT), Anthropic (Claude), and Google Gemini from a single config screen
- **AI product image generation** — generate a product image from a prompt (or a configurable default) right from the Images And Videos section, added straight to the gallery (OpenAI & Gemini)
- **AI product image editing** — pick any existing product image, describe the change in a prompt (or use a configurable default), preview the edited result side-by-side with the original, and replace it in the gallery on confirm (OpenAI & Gemini)
- **Global baseline prompt** — set brand voice, language, compliance and SEO rules once and have them automatically applied to every text generation (full, short, and custom prompts) across all providers
- Generate product descriptions using a **custom free-form prompt** for full control and flexibility
- Generate configured product attributes from an AI analysis of the existing product image, with per-attribute prompt instructions and structured JSON output
- Batch-run product image metadata generation from the Magento CLI
- Customize prompt templates using `{{ product.name }}` and `{{ product.attributes }}` variables
- Select **multiple product attributes** to base generation on (name, material, features, etc.)
- Configure **max tokens** and **temperature** separately for full and short descriptions
- Works on both **existing** and **unsaved (new) products**
- Supports OpenAI chat and completion endpoints (`gpt-4o`, `gpt-4-turbo`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`, etc.)
- Supports Anthropic Messages API (`claude-opus-4-5`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-haiku-4-5`, etc.)
- Supports Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash`, `gemini-2.5-pro`, etc.)
- Clean, valid HTML output ready to use in the WYSIWYG editor
- Compatible with Page Builder

## Usage

### Setup
1. Go to `Stores > Configuration > Mageprince > MageAI`
2. Choose your preferred AI **Provider** (Gemini, OpenAI, or Anthropic)
3. Enter the **API key** for the selected provider
4. Select the **model** and tune **max tokens** / **temperature** as needed
5. Configure the **image generation** and **image editing** prompts/models if you plan to use the image features
6. Save the configuration

> All features below work on both **new (unsaved)** and **existing** products. Remember to save the product to persist generated content and images.

### Generate Descriptions
1. Open any product and locate the Short or Long Description editor
2. Click **"Generate with MageAI"**
3. The AI generates polished, HTML-ready content based on the product name and the attributes you selected in config
4. Review and save the product

### Custom Prompt (Descriptions)
Click **"Advanced Generate with MageAI"** to open the custom prompt modal and type any free-form instruction — the module skips attribute lookup and sends your prompt directly to the AI.

### Generate Product Image
Click **"Generate Image with MageAI"** next to the **Add Video** button in the Images And Videos section. Enter a prompt (or leave it empty to use the default configured prompt) and the generated image is added straight to the product gallery. Available with the **OpenAI** and **Gemini** providers.

### Edit Product Image
Click **"Edit Image with MageAI"** (next to the generate button) to open a popup listing the product's current images. Click **"Edit with MageAI"** under any image, describe the change in a prompt (or leave it empty to use the default configured modify prompt), and the AI returns an edited version shown side-by-side with the original. Click **Confirm & Replace** to swap the original image with the edited one — its base/role, position, and visibility are preserved, and the change is saved with the product. Available with the **OpenAI** and **Gemini** providers.

### Generate Product Attributes From Images

Configure **Product Image Analysis > Update These Attributes Based on Product Image Analysis** with one row per target product attribute. Each row has its own prompt description, and existing values for those configured attributes are sent as context so blank fields can be generated from populated title, description, or keyword fields.

Click **"Analyze Images with MageAI and update content"** after **"Edit Image with MageAI"** in the Images And Videos section to analyze the saved product image and populate the configured attributes in the product form.

The CLI command analyzes each product's existing image through the configured OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint and writes the configured attributes:

```bash
php bin/magento mageai:generate:image-metadata --limit=25
php bin/magento mageai:generate:image-metadata --sku=ABC123 --dry-run
php bin/magento mageai:generate:image-metadata --product-id=123 --force
```

By default the command processes product type `image`, skips products whose configured image-analysis attributes are already populated, and does not overwrite non-placeholder titles. Use `--force` to overwrite existing configured values.

For OpenAI-compatible providers, set **Stores > Configuration > Mageprince > MageAI > API Configuration > Base URL** to either the provider root URL or its `/v1` URL. Use **Custom OpenAI-Compatible Model** when the provider's model ID is not in the built-in dropdown.

### Prompt Templates
Description and image prompts support two variables:
- `{{ product.name }}` — the product's name
- `{{ product.attributes }}` — a comma-separated `Label: Value` string from the attributes you selected in config (descriptions and image prompts have independent attribute selections)

## How to Install

```bash
composer require mageprince/magento2-mage-ai
